# controller2x: Controller Controller

Get it? Because it's a thing that controls your controller's behavior?

I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.


# Usage

`python3 controller2x.py controller_config.yaml`

controller2x is still being developed and is pretty half-baked right now.

Basic functionality is there, at least.
